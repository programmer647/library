# library



Page needs to 
- add books
- add people
- search books by title
- search books by author
- "borrow" book
- admin reports- overdue books - who has borrowed what
- anything else you think might be useful





Currently doing:
improve overdue page so that it shows the book title and the name of the person who it is on loan to



Next steps:

modify other pages to include better search that's used on return books page
create a table for authors so that there isn't repeated data in tblbooks. make it update automatically when adding books so that you don't have to add authors 
see if the username can be the primary key if a method is put in to ensure there are no repeated usernames
way for admin to view all books currently out of the library

improve search mechanism



add copies and on_loan to books database then do that if it isn't in the library you can't loan it. also add to the reserves page that you can be notified when it comes back into the library


add headers to all pages to redirect if either not logged in or don't have the right role to access a page



Things to do at the end:
remove printing arrays at the beginning of pages and removed the connected successfully message




other things I could add
make a way to alert a user when a book they want is back in 
email reminders to people to return their books
add a flag when a user returns a book if it is overdue so that they can be fined for it

stuff to ask for help on:
