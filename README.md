pages to make 
login page
home page
browse books


Page needs to 
- add books
- add people
- search books by title
- search books by author
- "borrow" book
- admin reports- overdue books - who has borrowed what
- anything else you think might be useful


tables I will need
tblusers (userID,username,surname,forename,password,role) (role will be either admin or user but add teacher as well as they might be able to borrow different books, or create reading lists for pupils)
tblbooks (bookID,title,author,fiction/non fiction) (possibly add other fields like genres later on)
