# library



Page needs to 
- add books
- add people
- search books by title
- search books by author
- "borrow" book
- admin reports- overdue books - who has borrowed what
- anything else you think might be useful





Currently doing:
create a table for authors so that there isn't repeated data in tblbooks. make it update automatically when adding books so that you don't have to add authors 


Next steps:
modify other pages to include better search that's used on return books page
way for user to view all books they have reserved and have out of the library
allow users to remove books they have reserved
improve admin home page
improve home page
way for users to edit their details eg password or username
add images of book covers to database
change browse books page to include images and improve it - maybe make it like the school page
add a way for admins to search for users

improve search mechanism



add copies and on_loan to books database then do that if it isn't in the library you can't loan it. also add to the reserves page that you can be notified when it comes back into the library


add headers to all pages to redirect if either not logged in or don't have the right role to access a page



Things to do at the end:
remove printing arrays at the beginning of pages and removed the connected successfully message




other things I could add
make a way to alert a user when a book they want is back in 
email reminders to people to return their books
add a flag when a user returns a book if it is overdue so that they can be fined for it

stuff to ask for help on:
